# Preprocessing Project

## Overview
This project focuses on preprocessing data to prepare it for analysis and machine learning tasks. Proper preprocessing is essential for improving model performance, ensuring data quality, and handling issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data types. This project includes steps to clean, transform, and engineer features from a given dataset, setting a solid foundation for further analysis.

## Project Contents

### Files
- **PreprocessingProject.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all preprocessing steps, explanations, and code implementations.
- **Dataset.csv**: The raw dataset used in this project for preprocessing.
- **Dataset Description.csv**: Contains metadata and descriptions of each feature in the dataset.

### Key Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Handles missing values by filling or dropping them as needed.
   - Removes duplicate entries and outliers.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Standardizes or normalizes features to ensure consistency.
   - Encodes categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creates new features to enhance model input.
   - Extracts important information from existing features for better analysis.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualizes key aspects of the data, including distributions, correlations, and outlier detection.
   - Provides insights that guide preprocessing decisions.
